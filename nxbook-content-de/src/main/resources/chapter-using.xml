    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Nexus provides for anonymous access for users who only need to
    search repositories, browse repositories, and peruse the system feeds.
    This anonymous access level changes the navigation menu and some of the
    options available when you right-click on a repository. This read-only
    access displays a user interface shown in <xref
    linkend="fig-repoman-anonymous-interface" />.</para>

  <section id="using-sect-browsing">
    <title>Browsing Repositories</title>

    <para>One of the most straight-forward uses of the Nexus is to browse the
    structure of a Maven repository. If you click on the Browse Repositories
    menu item in the Views menu, you should see the following display. The
    top-half of <xref linkend="fig-nexus-browse-repo" /> shows you a list of
    groups and repositories along with the type of the repository and the
    repository status.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>When you are browsing a repository, you can right click on any file
    and download it directly to your browser. This allows you to retrieve
    specific artifacts manually, or examine a <acronym>POM</acronym> file in
    the browser.</para>

    <note>
      <para>When browsing a remote repository you might notice that the tree
      doesn't contain all of the artifacts in a repository. When you browse a
      proxy repository, Nexus is displaying the artifacts which have been
      cached locally from the remote repository. If you don't see an artifact
      you expected to see through Nexus, it only means that Nexus has yet to
      cache the artifact locally. If you have enabled remote repository index
      downloads, Nexus will return search results that may include artifacts
      not yet downloaded from the remote repository. <xref
      linkend="fig-nexus-browse-repo" /> is just an example, and you may or
      may not have the <varname>maven-default-skin</varname> artifact
      available in your installation of Nexus.</para>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section id="using-sect-browsing-groups">
    <title>Browsing Groups</title>

    <para>Nexus contains ordered groups of repositories which allow you to
    expose a series of repositories through a single <acronym>URL</acronym>.
    More often than not, an organization is going to point Maven at the two
    default Nexus groups: Public Repositories and Public Snapshot
    Repositories. Most end-users of Nexus are not going to know what artifacts
    are being served from what specific repository, and they are going to want
    to be able to browse the Public Repository. To support this use case,
    Maven allows you to browse the contents of a Nexus Group as if it were a
    single merged repository with a tree structure. <xref
    linkend="fig-nexus-browse-group" /> shows the browsing interface with a
    Nexus Group selected for browsing. There is no difference to the user
    experience of browsing a Nexus Group vs. browsing a Nexus
    Repository.</para>

  <section id="using-sect-searching">
    <title>Searching for Artifacts</title>

    <para>In the left-hand navigation area, there is a Artifact Search text
    field next to a magnifying glass. To search for an artifact by groupId or
    artifactId, type in some text and click the magnifying glass. Typing in
    the the search term "maven" and clicking the magnifying glass should yield
    a search result similar to <xref linkend="fig-nexus-search" />.</para>

          <imagedata fileref="figs/web/repository-manager_artifact-search.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Once you've located the artifact you were looking for you can click
    on the Download link to download the artifact. Nexus is going to show you
    50 results at a time, and provide links on the bottom of the search result
    panel for you to navigate through the search results. If you would prefer
    to see a list of all of the matching artifacts, you can select Fetch All
    from the drop down at the bottom of the search result panel.</para>

    <para>In addition to searching by a groupId or an artifactId, Nexus has a
    feature which allows you to search for an artifact by a checksum.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Let me guess? You installed Nexus, ran to the search box, typed in
      the name of a group or an artifact, pressed search, and saw absolutely
      nothing. No results. Nexus isn't going to retrieve the remote repository
      indexes by default, you need to activate downloading of remote indexes
      for the three proxy repositories that Nexus ships with. Without these
      indexes, Nexus has nothing to search. Find instructions for activating
      index downloads in <xref linkend="sect-repoman-post-install" />.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Uploading Artifacts</title>

    <para>When you build makes use of proprietary or custom dependencies which
    are not available from public repositories, you will often need to find a
    way to make them available to developers in a custom Maven repository.
    Nexus ships with a preconfigured 3rd Party repository that was designed to
    hold 3rd Party dependencies which are used in your builds. To upload
    artifacts to a repository, select a hosted repository in the Repositories
    panel and then click on the Artifact Upload tab. Clicking on the Artifact
    Upload tab will display the tab shown in <xref
    linkend="fig-using-artifact-upload" />.</para>

    <figure id="fig-using-artifact-upload">
      <title>Artifact Upload Form</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="figs/web/using_artifact-upload.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>To upload an artifact, click on Select Artifact(s) for Upload... and
    select one or more artifacts from the filesystem to upload. Once you have
    selected an artifact, you can modify the classifier and the extension
    before clicking on the Add Artifact button. Once you have clicked on the
    Add Artifact button, you can then configure the source of the Group,
    Artifact, Version (GAV) parameters. If the artifact you are uploading is a
    JAR file that was created by Maven it will already have POM information
    embedded in it, but if you are uploading a JAR from a vendor you will
    likely need to set the Group Identifier, Artifact Identifier, and Version
    manually. To do this, select GAV Parameters from the GAV Definition
    dropdown at the top of this form. Selecting GAV Parameters will expose a
    set of form fields which will let you set the Group, Artifact, Version,
    and Packaging of the artifacts being uploaded. If you would prefer to set
    the Group, Artifact, and Version from a POM file which was associated with
    the uploaded artifact, select From POM in the GAV Definition dropdown.
    Selecting From POM in this dropdown will expose a button labelled "Select
    POM to Upload". Once a POM file has been selected for upload, the name of
    the POM file will be displayed in the form field below this button.</para>

    <para>The Artifact Upload panel supports multiple artifacts with the same
    Group, Artifact, and Version identifiers. For example, if you need to
    upload multiple artifacts with different classifiers, you may do so by
    clicking on Select Artifact(s) for Upload and Add Artifact multiple
    times.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="using-sect-browsing-system">
    <title>Browsing System Feeds</title>

    <para>Nexus provides feeds that capture system events, you can browse
    these feeds by clicking on System Feeds under the View menu. Clicking on
    System Feeds will show the panel in <xref
    linkend="fig-repoman-system-feeds" />. You can use these simple interface
    to browse the most recent reports of artifact deployments, cached
    artifacts, broken artifacts, and storage changes that have occurred in
    Nexus.</para>

    <figure id="fig-repoman-system-feeds">
      <title>Browsing Nexus System Feeds</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="figs/web/repository-manager_system-feed.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>These feeds can come in handy if you are working at a large
    organization with multiple development teams deploying to the same
    instance of Nexus. If such an arrangement, all developers in an
    organization can subscribe to the <acronym>RSS</acronym> feeds for New
    Deployed Artifacts as a way to ensure that everyone is aware when a new
    release has been pushed to Nexus. Exposing these system events as
    <acronym>RSS</acronym> feeds also opens to the door to other, more
    creative uses of this information, such as connecting Nexus to external
    automated testing systems. To access the <acronym>RSS</acronym> feeds for
    a specific feed, select the feed in the System Feeds view panel and then
    click on the Subscribe button. Nexus will then load the
    <acronym>RSS</acronym> feed in your browse and you can subscribe to the
    feed in your favorite <acronym>RSS</acronym> reader.</para>

    <para>There are six system feeds available in the System Feeds view, and
    each has a <acronym>URL</acronym> which resembles the following
    <acronym>URL</acronym>:</para>

    <screen>http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/feeds/recentlyChangedFiles</screen>

    <para>Where <varname>recentChanges</varname> would be replaced with the
    identifier of the feed you were attempting to read. Available system feeds
    include:</para>
