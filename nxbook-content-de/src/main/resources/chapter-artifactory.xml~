  <title>Migrating to Nexus from Artifactory</title>

  <section id="artifactory-sect-introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This appendix walks you through the process of using the Nexus
    Migration Plugin to migrate an existing Artifactory installation to a new
    Nexus installation. The Nexus Migration Plugin can read an Artifactory
    System Export archive and recreate groups and repositories based on your
    existing Artifactory installation. Once the migration is completed, the
    Nexus Artifactory Bridge will then serve repository artifacts to clients
    using a web application which exposes the same artifacts to clients using
    the same URLs and repository identifier that they referenced in your
    legacy Artifactory installation. This Nexus Migration plugin offers an
    easy, drop-in replacement for Artifactory.</para>

    <title>Creating an Artifactory Backup</title>

    <para>The Nexus Migration plugin relies on the Artifactory System Export
    which is an ZIP archive containing all of the configuration and data for
    an Artifactory installation. To generate this export, log in as an
    administrative user in Artifactory, and click on the
    <guibutton>System</guibutton> link under <guilabel>Import &amp;
    Export</guilabel> in the left navigation menu. Clicking on this link will
    show the <guilabel>Entire System Export &amp; Import</guilabel> screen as
    shown in <xref linkend="fig-creating-artifactory-backup" />.</para>

    <para>This appendix assumes that Artifactory has been installed in the
    directory <filename>/usr/local/artifactory-2.0.2</filename>. To create a
    backup ZIP archive in that same directory:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Enter <filename>/usr/local/artifactory-2.0.2</filename> into the
        <guilabel>Target export dir</guilabel> field. If you are on a Windows
        platform, or if you have installed Artifactory in a different path,
        enter the path at which Artifactory is installed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Check the <guilabel>Create a zip archive (slow!)</guilabel>
        checkbox as shown in <xref
        linkend="fig-creating-artifactory-backup" />.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Click the <guibutton>Export</guibutton> button.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>When you click the <guibutton>Export</guibutton> button, Artifactory
    is going to create a timestamped ZIP archive in the specified directory.
    In this example, Artifactory creates a file named
    <filename>/usr/local/artifactory-2.0.2/20090314.154349.zip</filename>.
    Once this step is completed, you will no longer need to run Artifactory,
    and you can safely shut it down. In the next section you will learn how to
    install the Nexus Migration Plugin.</para>

    <title>Installation of the Migration Plugin</title>

    <para>The migration plugin is a free, open-source plugin that can be
    downloaded by visiting <ulink
    url="${nexusmigration.about.url}">${nexusmigration.about.url}</ulink> or
    by downloading the plugin directly from Sonatype's Public Nexus Repository
    <ulink
    url="${nexusmigration.plugin.url}">${nexusmigration.plugin.url}</ulink>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>This section assumes that you have just downloaded and installed
      Nexus Open Source or Nexus Professional. If you haven't installed Nexus,
      you should make a bookmark for this section and jump to <xref
      linkend="install" />. Once you have installed Nexus, return to this
      section and install the Nexus Migration Plugin.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The following screen listing shows a series of commands which can be
    used to install the Nexus Migration plugin into an existing Nexus
    installation. This listing assumes that the environment variable
    <varname>\${NEXUS_HOME}</varname> points to an existing Nexus
    installation. Download the Nexus Migration plugin, copy the distribution
    archive to the Nexus installation folder, and unpack it. This archive will
    install the necessary applications and plugins to enable a smooth
    migration from Artifactory to Nexus.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>The Nexus Migration plugin archive contains a copy of
      <filename>conf/plexus.xml</filename>. If you have customized
      <filename>plexus.conf</filename>, you will want to make a backup of your
      customized <filename>plexus.xml</filename> before you install this
      Migration plugin. Most people using the Nexus Migration plugin are going
      to be setting up a new instance of Nexus so this shouldn't be an issue.
      If you are migrating an Artifactory repository to an existing instance
      of Nexus with a customized <filename>plexus.xml</filename>, you will
      need to compare your customized <filename>plexus.xml</filename> to the
      version in the Nexus Migration plugin archive paying close attention to
      the <sgmltag>webappInfos</sgmltag> element in the Jetty configuration.
      The Nexus Migration plugin modifies this file, adding a new web
      application served under the context path
      <filename>/artifactory</filename> which provides a mapping between
      legacy Artifactory URLs and new Nexus URLs.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>Once the Nexus Migration plugin has been installed, start up Nexus
    and go to the Nexus URL. If you are just setting up Nexus, and you've
    skipped the installation chapter, the default Nexus URL is <ulink
    url="http://localhost:8081/nexus">http://localhost:8081/nexus</ulink> and
    the default administrative username/password combination is "admin" and
    "admin123". If the Nexus Migration Plugin is installed properly, you
    should see the <guilabel>Artifactory Import</guilabel> link under
    <guilabel>Administration</guilabel> in the Nexus application menu as shown
    in <xref linkend="fig-artifactory-import-panel" />.</para>

    Artifactory system backup archive in the <guilabel>Artifactory

    linkend="fig-artifactory-import-backup" />. This path references a
    filesystem path on the same server that is running Nexus.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Please note that the filesystem path in Step 1 of the Artifactory
      Import process references a path on the same server that is running
      Nexus. This field is not a file upload field, and you are not uploading
      the Artifactory System Backup archive from your local machine to the
      server. The Artifactory system export archive can be rather large, and
      the assumption of the Nexus Migration plugin is that you are installing
      Nexus on the same server that had previously run Artifactory. If you are
      not installing Nexus on the same server, you must upload the Artifactory
      System Backup ZIP file to the Nexus server prior to typing in the
      filesystem path shown in <xref

    <para>Once the System Backup has been imported, the Nexus Migration plugin
    will populate the Groups, Repositories, and Users tables in Step 2 of the
    Artifactory Import panel as shown in <xref
    linkend="fig-artifactory-configuring-import" />. These tables and form
    elements allow you to customize which repositories and groups are going to
    be imported into Nexus and how Nexus will configure corresponding
    repositories. The following sections describe each of these configuration
    tables in detail.</para>

      wish to omit an Artifactory group from the import process, deselect the
      checkbox for that group in the Import column. Each group's content type
      resolution is shown in the Content Type Resolution column. Changing the
      content type resolution will control how Nexus configures the Nexus
      Group that corresponds to each Artifactory Group.</para>

      <para>The second table in Step 2 of the Artifactory Import panel is the
      Repostiories panel. In this panel you can select repositories to import
      and also configure how Artifactory proxy repositories would be mapped to
      Nexus proxy repository with matching canonical URLs. Each row in the

            Central Maven Repository. As both of these repositories have the
            same URL, the Nexus Migration plugin will show a checkbox in the

    you installed the Nexus Migration plugin, you also installed a web
    application called the Artifactory Bridge which should be running under
    the context path <filename>/artifactory</filename> next to the
    <filename>/nexus</filename> application. If you run Nexus at the default
    <ulink
    url="http://localhost:8081/nexus/">http://localhost:8081/nexus/</ulink>
    URL, the artifactory bridge will be running at <ulink
    url="http://localhost:8081/artifactory/">http://localhost:8081/artifactory/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>This Artifactory Bridge will serve repository metadata and artifacts
    from Nexus under the same URLs that your existing Artifactory clients
    expect. When you were configuring your repositories during the Artifactory
    Import in <xref linkend="fig-artifactory-config-repository-imports" />,
    you'll remember that there was a column named <guilabel>Map
    URL</guilabel>. Clicking on this <guilabel>Map URL</guilabel> check box
    for a repository instructed the Nexus Migration plugin to configure a
    mapping between the old Artifactory URL and repository identifer and the
    new Nexus URL and repository identifier.</para>

    <para>To see this mapping in action, take a look at the Central repository
    through three different URLs. This example assumes that you mapped your
    old <varname>repo1</varname> Artifactory proxy repository to the Nexus
    <varname>central</varname> proxy repository. Let's take a quick look at
    the URL for <filename>metadata.xml</filename> for the
    <varname>nexus-index</varname> artifact which is under the group
    identifier <varname>org.sonatype.nexus</varname>. To retrieve this
    directly from the Central Maven repository, you would use the following
    URL: </para>

    <screen>http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/sonatype/nexus/nexus-indexer/maven-metadata.xml</screen>

    <para>To reterieve the same file from the Nexus <varname>central</varname>
    proxy of the Central Maven repository, you would use the following URL
    which contains the new Nexus repository identifier "central":</para>

    <screen>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/central/org/sonatype/nexus/nexus-indexer/maven-metadata.xml</screen>

    <para>To retrieve the same file from the Artifactory Bridge, you would use
    the following URL which contains the old Artifactory repository identifier
    "repo1":</para>

    <screen>http://localhost:8081/artifactory/repo1/org/sonatype/nexus/nexus-indexer/maven-metadata.xml</screen>

    <para>The configuration for these mappings is stored in
    <filename>sonatype-work/nexus/conf/mapping.xml</filename>. This is an XML
    file which was configured during the import that maps the old Artifactory
    repository identifiers to the new Nexus repository identifiers. The
    Artifactory Bridge web application is configured in
    <filename>\${NEXUS_HOME}/conf/plexus.xml</filename> contains a reference to
    the web application and also configures the context-path
    <filename>/artifactory</filename>.</para>
