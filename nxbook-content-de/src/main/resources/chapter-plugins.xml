    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>While Nexus is a capable repository management and collaboration
    platform without any plugin extensions, Sonatype has provide a way for
    developers to extend the feature set of Nexus by exposing a plugin API.
    This chapter is a brief survey of some of the plugins which are available
    for Nexus.</para>

  <section id="plugins-sect-install">
    <title>Installing Plugins</title>

    <para>Nexus plugins are incredibly easy to install. All you need to do to
    install a Nexus plugin is to put the Plugin JAR file in
    <filename>\${NEXUS_HOME}/runtime/apps/nexus/lib</filename>. As long as the
    plugin JAR is in the classpath of Nexus, it will be loaded the next time
    Nexus starts.</para>

  <section id="plugins-sect-available">
    <title>Available Plugins</title>

    <para>The following sections list some of the available plugins. Some of
    the plugins in this list are very simple, like the Google Analytics
    Plugin. Other plugins such as the Staging Suite and Procurement Suite are
    of sufficient complexity to deserve an entire chapter of
    documentation.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Nexus Staging Suite</title>

      <para>The Nexus Staging Suite provides an organization with an easy way
      to deploy artifacts to a temporary staging repository prior to a full
      releases. Using the features in the Nexus Staging Suite, developers
      deploy to a hosted repository only to have the deployed artifacts
      intercepted by a staging profile and held in a temporary staging
      repository. Once artifacts have been deployed to a temporary staging
      repository, Nexus administrators, release engineers, and QA personnel
      can then validate and certify a set of staged artifact before they are
      either promoted to a hosted repository or discarded.</para>

      <para>The Nexus Staging Suite is an essential tool for organizations
      that need to incorporate QA into the release cycle. For more information
      about the Nexus Staging Suite, see <xref linkend="staging" />.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="plugins-sect-procurement">
      <title>Nexus Procurement Suite</title>

      <para>Many organizations want to have some control over the third-party
      dependencies used in a system. This could be for a number of reasons.
      Maybe an architecture groups wants to limit access to a set of approved
      frameworks, or maybe the product's legal team wants to make sure that
      the licenses of every open source library incorporated into a project
      has gone through some evaluation process. Whatever the reason, the Nexus
      Procurement Suite gives a Nexus Administrator some control over what
      artifacts are going to be made available from a proxied
      repository.</para>

      <para>The Nexus Procurement Suite gives organizations some control over
      inbound, third-party Maven artifacts. If you need to control and specify
      which dependencies are allow in your organization, you should learn
      about the Maven Procurement Plugin introduced in <xref
      linkend="procurement" />.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="plugins-sect-ldap">
      <title>LDAP Authentication</title>

      <para>When an organization needs to integrate Nexus with LDAP, it can do
      so by installing the LDAP Authentication plugin. This plugin adds the
      necessary configuration panels and modifies the security subsystem of
      Nexus to delegate authentication and access control to an external LDAP
      server. You can configure Nexus roles to match roles for users in LDAP
      and use these roles to manage access to Nexus resources.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="plugins-sect-google">
      <title>Google Analytics Plugin</title>

      <para>The Google Analytics Plugin is a simple plugin that simply inserts
      the Google Analytics tracking code just before the closing body tag in
      the Nexus HTML. To configure the Google Analytics plugin, you will need
      to put your organization's Google Analytics Web Property ID in the
      <filename>\${SONATYPE_WORK}/nexus/conf/ga-tracking-id.txt</filename>
      file.</para>

      <para>If the \${SONATYPE_WORK}/nexus/conf/ga-tracking-id.txt file
      contains the value "UA-16932923-9", then the Nexus markup should contain
      the following HTML just before the closing body tag:</para>
